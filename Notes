A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.

A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations.

A column is a set of data values of a particular type. Here, id, name, and age are the columns

A row is a single record in a table. 

Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.

Function to create table

//params 1...n are the columns (attributes) of the table
//TYPE_1...TYPE_n are the types of the respective columns. For ex: TEXT or INTEGER
CREATE TABLE table_name(
		Param_1 TYPE_1,
		Param_2 TYPE_2,
		…
		Param_n TYPE_n
);

Function to add row to data table
//col_1...col_n are the attributes that you will initialize in this fxn
//val_1...val_n are the to which col1...col_n will be initialized
INSERT INTO table_name (col_1….col_n)
VALUES(val_1...val_n);

SELECT statements are used to fetch data from a database. In the statement below
//note: can use * instead of column_name to select all columns in a table
	SELECT column_name FROM table_name

Function to add column to table
//adds column to end of table
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	ADD COLUMN col_name data_type_of_col

Function to edit a row in a data table
//WHERE clause specifies the row in the table to be edited
	UPDATE table_name
	SET col_name = new_data
	WHERE any_col_name = specific_val

EX:
//update the twitter_handle column of the entry with id = 4 to ‘taylor_swift’
	UPDATE celebs
	SET twitter_handle = ‘taylor_swift’
	WHERE id = 4

Fxn to delete row from table
//deletes the row where col_name is entry_name
	DELETE FROM table_name
	WHERE col_name IS entry_name

EX: 
//deletes rows that have NULL twitter handle
	DELETE FROM celebs
	WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;

Constraints 
Add info about how a column can be used
Allows database to reject insertion attempts that do not adhere to constraints
Ex: 
CREATE TABLE celebs (
	Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY //attempt to insert a row with a id value equal to one already in the table will not work. You can only have one primary key, but you can have multiple columns within a primary key
	Name TEXT UNIQUE, //must have different value for every row. Table can have multiple UNIQUE columns
	Date_of_birth TEXT NOT NULL, //attempt to add a row with NULL date_of_birth will not work
	date_of_death TEXT DEFAULT ‘not applicable’ //if date of death is not supplied in row insertion, then it will default to ‘not applicable’
	);

Selecting a column and adding a temporary name to it
	SELECT column AS alias
	FROM table_name

Selecting distinct values in a column
	SELECT DISTINCT col_name
	FROM table_name

Filtering out certain results in a query using WHERE clause
Where clause supports NULL (ex: WHERE col_name IS(NOT) NULL)
	SELECT * FROM table_name
	WHERE column_name (boolean statement)

LIKE Clauss
Note: case sensitive
Use \ operator to search for underscores and % signs
	SELECT *
	FROM table_name
	//the row of any string that satisfies the pattern below will be selected in query. Can be used for numerical values too, but it must be wrapped in ‘ ‘
	WHERE col_name LIKE (string where _ is a variable character)

% operator
Works as 0 or more _, useful for pattern matching

BETWEEN Clause
Used to get values between two characters or letters
	Ex: WHERE col_name BETWEEN ‘A’ AND ‘J’; 
Exclusive of 2nd letter (above ex excludes J)
Inclusive of second number

AND Clause
Used to combine conditions
	SELECT * from table_name
	Where condition1
	AND condition2
	
OR clause
Similar to and cause, but is satisfied if any of the conditions in it are true
ORs and ANDs can be combined using parentheses

Sorting Data
Always insert ORDER BY clause after WHERE
	ORDER BY col_name //defaults to ascending
	ORDER BY col_name DESC // sorts in descending order

Capping number of results in a query using LIMIT
Always goes at the end of the query

CASE statement allows if else logic
Creates a new column in a query, where the entries of the column are defined according to the ‘THEN’ conditions
The ‘THEN’ conditions can be multiple data types
	SELECT col_name_1,...,col_name_n
	   CASE
	      WHEN (condition1) then ‘label_for_new_col’
	      WHEN (condition2) then 2131243 //can be any data type
      …
   End
From table_name

Aggregates are calculations performed on multiple rows of a table, for ex:
	count(col_name) from table; //returns the number of nonempty rows in col_name. Col_name can be *, will count duplicate rows twice
	sum(col_name) // returns sum of all values in col_name
	max(col_name) and min(col_name) //return max and min values in column, respectively
